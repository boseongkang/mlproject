#Project Title : **Make your song Bilboard Top 100**  
<hr>
Authors : Boseong Kang, Geonho Lee
<br>
Description of Question and Research Topic (5 Sentences)
This project aims to comprehensively analyze lyric embeddings and the characteristics of commonly used instruments for Billboard's Top 100 songs, revealing trends over time. <br>
For example, if an artist is tryting to compose a song, our model can predict which instruments with lyrics would be used to enter a Billboard Top 100. <br>
We analyze trends by clustering lyrics and examining word similarity. <br>
Then analyze the instrument usage ratios by spectralizing the songs. <br>
Finally, we combine these two analyses to build a machine learning model that predicts chart entry probability. <br>

Project Outline/Plan
Data Collection Plan (two parts, one for each author)<br>
- Part 1: Boseong Kang <br>
Use billboard.py Python library to get Billboard top 100 song's title, rank, and artist. <br>
Using lyrics from websites have copyright issue so use lyrics data from kaggle. <br>
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bwandowando/spotify-songs-with-attributes-and-lyrics <br>
This data set has License CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 which means we can free to share, adapt if we use as NonCommercial and give appropriate credit. <br>

- Part 2: Geonho Lee <br>
Use the songs collected in Part 1 to analyze their audio characteristics. <br>
Convert each song’s WAV data into a frequency spectrum using NumPy and SciPy, and extract features such as band energy ratios (bass, vocal, cymbal). <br>
Estimate the instrument approximation energy ratios to identify which sound ranges are dominant in each song. <br>
Visualize the results using Matplotlib to compare how different tracks emphasize different sound bands. <br>
Compare audio patterns with lyrical patterns to analyze overall music trends. <br>

Model Plans (two parts, one for each author) <br>
- Part 1: Boseong Kang <br>
Logistic Regression: Similar to the MNIST Dataset, after preprocessing the data, use one-hot encoding or TF-IDF from scikit-learn to classify from the top 10 songs and others. <br>
MLP: With preprocessed words, we can classify the top 10 songs vs other songs using ReLu and the sigmoid activation function

- Part 2: Geonho Lee <br>
Visualization: Use Matplotlib to visualize each song’s frequency spectrum and energy distribution. <br> 
Model: Apply Logistic Regression from scikit-learn to analyze relationships between extracted audio features (band energy ratios) and data from Part 1. Additionally, since non-linear relationships can’t be properly captured by Logistic Regression, we will use MLP implemented with PyTorch to explore non-linear sound patterns across frequency bands.<br>
